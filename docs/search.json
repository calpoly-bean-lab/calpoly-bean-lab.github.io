Most of our research has a spatial dimension, from fine scale individual movement; habitat selection; to the past, present and future of species‚Äô distributions."

    "text": "California Channel Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Channel Islands are an incredible natural classroom, offering abundant opportunities to study small mammal and mesocarnivore dynamics. Working with the National Parks Service and The Nature Conservancy, we are studying the spatial ecology of Island foxes and Island spotted skunks on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. After a complicated trophic cascade due to the introduction of wild pigs, massive amounts of DDT dumped into the Southern California Bight, the disappearance of bald eagles and introduction of gold eagles, Island foxes declined to near extinction. Island skunks seemed to do well in their absence, but following fox recovery appear to have declined. Some of the questions students are asking include: how has fox home range size changed in relation to density? Where are the skunks, anyway?\n\n\nSan Joaquin Desert Conservation and Restoration\nThe San Joaquin Desert is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world, with high rates of endemic threatened and endangered species. Our work has helped identify habitat for protection and restoration, guided renewable energy project mitigation, and developed new techniques for counting kangaroo rats. Specific student research has included documenting the importance of kangaroo rat burrowing to facilitate San Joaquin antelope squirrel reintroduction; comparing trapping data to habitat suitability models and aerial images to guide conservation decisions; and assessing very fine scale blunt-nosed leopard lizard thermoregulation. We also manage the animal surveys every summer in the long-term Carrizo Plain Ecosystem Project, running since 2007.\n\n\nLarge Mammal Movement and Conservation\nThe advent of inexpensive, reliable GPS collars has allowed for new insight into animal movement and behavior. Students in the lab have used GPS collards to identify sites where Roosevelt elk give birth; demonstrated that differential fear of humans can lead to big changes in carrying capacity; and documented the ways in which tule elk respond to a historic drought. While all three subspecies of elk in California are recovering well, pronghorn in southern California are not. We are currently collaborating with The Nature Conservancy, Bureau of Land Management, and California Department of Fish & Wildlife to see if additional water sources might improve pronghorn population growth.\n\n\nBarn Owls as Natural Predators on Vineyards\nWe are so excited to partner with Dr.¬†Matt Johnson‚Äôs lab at Cal Poly Humboldt to extend his research on barn owls in Napa down to the Edna Valley. With high resolution GPS backpacks, we‚Äôre working to understand how owls hunt on vineyards.\n\n\nCalifornia Biodiversity Sentinel Site Network\nWe are working to establish more biodiversity and climate Sentinel Sites in partnership with California Department of Fish & Wildlife and the California Biodiversity Network. These sites use traditional trail cameras, drift fences with downward facing cameras, and bat and bird acoustic records to document biodiversity across the state. They also provide great opportunities for students to gain hands on experience deploying equipment, using next generation analyses, and a platform for developing their research using data from not just our campus but across the state.\n\n\nKangaroo Rat Ecology and Conservation\nKangaroo rats are an iconic mammalian species of western North America - or, they should be! As ecosystem engineers, they move millions of tons of soil every year, changing nutrient cycles and in turn altering plant and animal communities. They can help to control invasive species, and their burrows provide important habitat for other species in the community. They also provide a fascinating case study for biogeography. Some kangaroo rats are extreme specialists, found only in a handful of special habitats; other closely related species are generalists, found in lots of places throughout their range. Speciation in this group is surprisingly understudied, and we‚Äôre still learning about which species are found where.\n\n\nNorth American Porcupine Ecology and Conservation\nPorcupines seem to be disappearing throughout western North America, but we‚Äôre not sure why - more predators? More rodenticide? Disease? A century of human harassment and killing? Probably all of the above; our lab has studied porcupine ecology and natural history in northern California to better understand what might be limiting them. Along the way, we discovered that porcupines appear to ‚Äúscout‚Äù for good winter habitat during summer, a new kind of mammalian behavior."

He then spent 3 years working with the endangered New Mexico Meadow Jumping Mouse (Zapus luteus) in southern Colorado and New Mexico. This project had many research goals including understanding the species‚Äô home range selection, habitat suitability, and behavior, as well as endocrinology and hibernating physiology.\nIn the Bean Lab, Garrett‚Äôs research is part of a larger project looking into the narrow-faced kangaroo rat‚Äôs (Dipodomys venustus) range, taxonomy, and habitat suitability. Specifically, he is investigating the range-wide habitat suitability for the species, and comparing niche divergence amongst the genetically identified subspecies. In the future, Garrett is interested in exploring new ways in which the spatial ecology and evolution/genetics fields can work together to better understand the distribution of species in the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJen Ibarra\nMasters Student\n\nJen is interested in the use of fire as a land management tool and is investigating the impacts of cultural and prescribed burning on giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) habitat in and around the Carrizo Plain National Monument. She is also exploring the use of non-invasive surveys to update occupancy models that aim to predict the presence or absence of giant kangaroo rats and inform future management decisions.\nShe is a seasoned field biologist and has worked on field projects that include surveying and tracking of Mojave Desert tortoises, California condors, flat-tailed horned lizards, and California gnatcatchers. Jen looks forward to learning more about the natural world around her and supports the inclusion of traditional ecological knowledge and western science throughout her work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lopez\nMasters Student\n\nKevin is interested in all things related to raptor ecology. His research will focus on tracking nesting Barn Owls with GPS-biologgers equipped with accelerometers to understand how changes in habitat composition influence their habitat use and foraging behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaroline MacKenzie\nMasters Student\n\nCaroline MacKenzie received her bachelors in wildlife ecology from the University of Maine, working with small mammals and entomology. She‚Äôs traveled throughout the U.S working in Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and California, where her research focused on small mammals and long-term open source data collection. As part of the Bean Lab, Caroline investigates the dynamics of data synchrony in space and time when determining conservation priorities for the endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat. She is interested in why results from differing survey methods don‚Äôt align with one another, data reliability, and best practices for species-specific management decisions. Utilizing habitat suitability modeling, habitat quality analysis and live trapping, her project aims to define effective strategies to increase the accuracy of habitat suitability models by understanding why different assessment methods sometimes provide conflicting results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTricia Nguyen\nMasters Student\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesirae Thomaier\nMasters Student\n \nDesirae is interested in how species interactions shape ecological communities, especially with the implications of climate change and land use changes. She is particularly interested in noninvasive monitoring techniques and remote sensing to bridge the gap between conservation, technology, and human-wildlife coexistence. She received a B.S. in Biology from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2018. Desirae worked for the National Park Service trapping island foxes and skunks, the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels studying penguins in Argentina, and also has experience with molecular biology and veterinary science. Her Master‚Äôs research is investigating the spatial distribution of island spotted skunks with occupancy modeling via camera traps. In her free time she enjoys reading, baking, volleyball, and walks with her husband and two dogs."
