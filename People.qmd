### William "Tim" Bean, PhD

Associate Professor, Biological Sciences\
[{{<fa envelope>}}](mailto:wtbean@calpoly.edu) [{{<fa brands google-scholar>}}](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fWo1hH0AAAAJ&hl=en)

My goal is to train students to be excellent field biologists with strong quantitative skills. I usually work on mammals, mostly in California, using a combination of publicly available data, data collected in the field, and remote sensing techniques. I strongly believe we should learn to use, and develop, cutting edge techniques while remaining rooted in a strong tradition of natural history.

### Caroline MacKenzie

Masters Student\
{{<fa envelope>}}

Caroline MacKenzie received her bachelors in wildlife ecology from the University of Maine, working with small mammals and entomology. She's traveled throughout the U.S working in Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and California, where her research focused on small mammals and long-term open source data collection. As part of the Bean Lab, Caroline investigates the dynamics of data synchrony in space and time when determining conservation priorities for the endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat. She is interested in why results from differing survey methods don't align with one another, data reliability, and best practices when making decisions for protection and presence of species. Utilizing habitat suitability modeling, habitat quality analysis and live trapping, her project helps to delineate potential strategies to increase accuracy in implementing management and protections as well as reasons why using multiple methods sometimes don't align with one another and possibilities to correct these mismatches.
