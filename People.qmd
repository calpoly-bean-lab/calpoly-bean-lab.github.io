My goal is to train students to be excellent field biologists with strong quantitative skills. I usually work on mammals of all sizes, particularly in California, using a combination of publicly available data, data collected in the field, and remote sensing techniques. I strongly believe we should learn to use, and develop, cutting edge techniques while remaining rooted in a strong tradition of natural history.
