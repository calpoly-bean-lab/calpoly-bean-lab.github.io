Working with the National Parks Service and The Nature Conservancy, we are studying the spatial ecology of Island foxes and Island spotted skunks on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. After a complicated trophic cascade due to the introduction of wild pigs, massive amounts of DDT dumped into the Southern California Bight, the disappearance of bald eagles and introduction of gold eagles, Island foxes declined to near extinction. Island skunks seemed to do well in their absence, but following fox recovery appear to have declined. Some of the questions students are asking include: how has fox home range size changed in relation to density? Where are the skunks, anyway?\n\n\nSan Joaquin Desert Conservation and Restoration\n[GKR, SJAS, solar energy, habitat conservation]\n\n\nLarge Mammal Movement and Conservation\n[elk + pronghorn]\n\n\nBarn Owls as Natural Predators on Vineyards\n[collaboration with Humboldt, link to Matt’s stuff]\n\n\nCalifornia Biodiversity Sentinel Site Network\n[link to CDFW, link to Chorro Creek ER page]\n\n\nKangaroo Rat Ecology and Conservation\n[Garrett; biogeography]\n\n\nNorth American Porcupine Ecology and Conservation\n[Disappearing porcupines; scouting]"
