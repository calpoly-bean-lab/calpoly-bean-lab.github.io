We will also consider students seeking research experience starting in the winter and spring quarters on a case-by-case basis, though opportunities are more limited.\n\n\nGraduate Students\nThough there are currently no openings in the lab, students interested in pursuing a masters degree with Dr. Bean may always reach out with project ideas."

    "text": "California Channel Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Channel Islands are an incredible natural classroom, offering abundant opportunities to study small mammal and mesocarnivore dynamics. Working with the National Parks Service and The Nature Conservancy, we are studying the spatial ecology of Island foxes and Island spotted skunks on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. After a complicated trophic cascade due to the introduction of wild pigs, massive amounts of DDT dumped into the Southern California Bight, the disappearance of bald eagles and introduction of gold eagles, Island foxes declined to near extinction. Island skunks seemed to do well in their absence, but following fox recovery appear to have declined. Some of the questions students are asking include: how has fox home range size changed in relation to density? Where are the skunks, anyway?\n\n\nSan Joaquin Desert Conservation and Restoration\n[GKR, SJAS, solar energy, habitat conservation]\n\n\nLarge Mammal Movement and Conservation\n[elk + pronghorn]\n\n\nBarn Owls as Natural Predators on Vineyards\n[collaboration with Humboldt, link to Matt’s stuff]\n\n\nCalifornia Biodiversity Sentinel Site Network\n[link to CDFW, link to Chorro Creek ER page]\n\n\nKangaroo Rat Ecology and Conservation\n[Garrett; biogeography]\n\n\nNorth American Porcupine Ecology and Conservation\n[Disappearing porcupines; scouting]"

She is also exploring the use of non-invasive surveys to update occupancy models that aim to predict the presence or absence of giant kangaroo rats and inform future management decisions.\nShe is a seasoned field biologist and has worked on field projects that include surveying and tracking of Mojave Desert tortoises, California condors, flat-tailed horned lizards, and California gnatcatchers. Jen looks forward to learning more about the natural world around her and supports the inclusion of traditional ecological knowledge and western science throughout her work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lopez\nMasters Student\n\nKevin is interested in all things related to raptor ecology. His research will focus on tracking nesting Barn Owls with GPS-biologgers equipped with accelerometers to understand how changes in habitat composition influence their habitat use and foraging behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaroline MacKenzie\nMasters Student\n\nCaroline MacKenzie received her bachelors in wildlife ecology from the University of Maine, working with small mammals and entomology. She’s traveled throughout the U.S working in Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and California, where her research focused on small mammals and long-term open source data collection. As part of the Bean Lab, Caroline investigates the dynamics of data synchrony in space and time when determining conservation priorities for the endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat. She is interested in why results from differing survey methods don’t align with one another, data reliability, and best practices when making decisions for protection and presence of species. Utilizing habitat suitability modeling, habitat quality analysis and live trapping, her project helps to delineate potential strategies to increase accuracy in implementing management and protections as well as reasons why using multiple methods sometimes don’t align with one another and possibilities to correct these mismatches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTricia Nguyen\nMasters Student\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesirae Thomaier\nMasters Student"
