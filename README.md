## Welcome to the Bean Lab website repository

-   Lab members editing the site: please familiarize yourself with writing Quarto (`.qmd`) documents for html publishing [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html).
-   You'll need to install a quarto extension for adding icons before rendering the website yourself; in the terminal tab in Rstudio you can run this to install it: `quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome`
-   Contact Scott or Tim if you have questions or any issues, and ideally only edit your own page or about yourself section on the **people** page.
